## Maria who?

Born in Lima, Peru, raised in Sydney, Australia... I have lived in the United States for the last 18 years.

My photography training began at the University of Western Sydney in New South Wales and has expanded through life experience and world travel to bring me to this place called Memphis, TN.

Through a glance or stare, a shimmer of sun or electronic flash; vision is an internal bond that connects us and helps make sense of this, our spiritual experience. Images of love, loss, pain, prosperity... freckles. Life is full and my passion is to capture it, one frame at a time.
